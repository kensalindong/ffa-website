# Developer Standards
<ol>
<li>Keep your code clean and readable. Make use of comments and linebreaks to do so.</li>
<li>Create a new branch for yourself (e.g. <i>ace-branch</i>). Don't use the 'master' branch when commiting your codes. Always use your own branch when doing so. The master branch will only be used for configuration and documentation changes. This allows us to control the revisions better.</li>
<li>Make your commit messages/summary specific. Use the description field to further describe your changes if further details are needed.</li>
<li>Do not stylize indvidual elements one by one as much as possible. Use our site-wide classes and ids to make it uniform.</li>
</ol>
